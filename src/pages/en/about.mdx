## About Us

We are 706 Tribe — also known as Camp 706.

We're a registered [Theme Camp](https://burningman.org/event/participate/camps/placement-process/criteria/#tc) where most of us speak Chinese. Our mission is to bring warm, interactive experiences to Black Rock City. Alongside our returning projects, we’re also working on new art installations this year — and we’d love for you to join us with your creativity and vision!

We fully embrace Burning Man’s Ten Principles and believe that contribution is one of the most meaningful ways to experience the Burn. Camp 706 is a Theme Camp, not a freecamp — we come together not just to build a community, but to offer something valuable back to Black Rock City. From past experience, we’ve learned that the more we give, the more we gain.

Some of our traditional offerings include calligraphy tattoos and Chinese-style massage. This year, we’re planning to add even more, such as a grilled cold noodle stand, a library/bookstore, movie screenings, and a bar with baijiu and wine. Details are still in progress — and you can help shape them. Our calligraphy tattoo and grilled cold noodle stand have already been invited to Center Camp Plaza.

Camp 706 is a playground for idealism — and we welcome you to bring your own, even just a little. Everyone in our camp helps build and prepare for months in advance, and everyone participates during the event. No exceptions. We co-create, we run activities, we clean up MOOP — every member is a builder.

Although we’re a service-oriented Theme Camp, we also host internal gatherings so we can connect more deeply with each other. Members often find the experience more rewarding, emotional, and meaningful than freecamping. The organic community we create through collaboration is what we value most.

In recent years, some parts of Burning Man have drifted away from the Ten Principles and become more commercialized. That’s why the Burning Man official released the [Cultural Direction Setting & Decommodification](https://burningman.org/event/participate/camps/cultural-direction-setting-decommodification/#Snapshot) initiative in 2019. Camp 706 fully supports this initiative and takes it seriously:

> Theme camps allocate their collective focus, time, and resources primarily toward their public contributions rather than personal comfort and convenience. We understand that commodifying resources (packaging, advertising, or marketing camp space, tickets, an experience, etc.) and allowing financial contributions to substitute for participation is **NOT** only in opposition to Burning Man’s values, but significantly damages the culture.

> When we create, contribute, and participate in Black Rock City, it inspires others to do the same. When one approaches Black Rock City as a consumer or a spectator, it discourages others from contributing. The success of Burning Man culture and Black Rock City will always rest on our community’s embrace of our shared cultural values.
