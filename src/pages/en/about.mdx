## About 706 Tribe

🏕 Who is 706 Tribe?

We are a Mandarin-speaking Theme Camp at Burning Man, dedicated to building a genuine, non-commercial, co-created community in Black Rock City.

We believe in all Ten Principles of Burning Man — and we practice them seriously.

We stand against commodified, all-inclusive camps and uphold a culture of full participation and contribution.

We believe that through service and giving, everyone can have a deeper and more meaningful Burning Man experience.

The “706” in 706 Tribe isn’t a secret code — it represents a spirit of staying rooted in culture and emotion, even when far from home. We are a group of Mandarin speakers who also believe that the spirit of Burning Man transcends language and culture.

🔥 What do we do on the Playa?

We are an officially registered Theme Camp at Burning Man, bringing interactive experiences with Chinese cultural flavor to Black Rock City.

Some of our past and ongoing offerings include (but are not limited to):

- Chinese calligraphy tattoos
- Traditional Chinese massage
- Outdoor bookstore / library
- Baijiu + wine bar
- Mandarin film screenings
- Grilled cold noodle food stand
- …and many more creative ideas from our camp members

We are constantly evolving, and we welcome you to join us with your ideas and enthusiasm.

Here, nothing is just “provided.” Everything is "co-created".

🧡 What do we believe?

We believe:

- Contribution is not a burden, but a gateway to real connection and meaningful experience.

We are committed to:

- Decommodification
- Refuse “plug-and-play”
- Active participation matters more than personal comfort

We support:

- Everyone finding their own way to contribute — whether through skills, creativity, or emotional presence
- Every member participating in the work — from building and maintenance to running events
- Every member being a creator, not a customer

🌍 Who do we welcome?

We welcome:

- Mandarin speakers from all over the world who resonate with Burning Man culture
- People with a little idealism, who aren’t afraid to sweat and love to share
- Those who want to fully experience Burning Man, not just observe it
- Both virgin and veteran Burners
- People with special skills — or none at all — as long as you're willing to learn and participate
