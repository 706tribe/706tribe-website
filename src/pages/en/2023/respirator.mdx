# Respirator

The playa is like a living being, with an unpredictable temperament that changes from one moment to the next. That inspired me to create an art installation that captures its essence — a piece that is light, amorphous, and in constant flux, just like the swirling sandstorms that dance across the playa.

Respirator is a 10’x10’x10 cube. Its transparent cube structure acts as both its protective skin and a display of its inner workings to the world. The cube’s openings serve as pores, allowing the wind to blow through and interact with the installation. The bubble is made out of soft fabric. Whenever the wind blows through, it takes on a different shape with the force of nature, like the breath of the desert.

It captures your eyes and invites you to pause and feel the wild breath of the land. It also invites visitors to step inside, which offers a more intimate encounter. As the wind permeates the bubble from various directions, it creates a tactile and sensory experience. Each breath taken within aligns with the frequency of the playa, forging a connection to the original heartbeat of the land.
