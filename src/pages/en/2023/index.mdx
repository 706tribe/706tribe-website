[706 Tribe in 2023 Camp Listing](https://burningman.org/event/participate/camps/camp-listings-archive/?yyyy=2023&tcq=706+Tribe)

In 2023, 706 Tribe remained part of the Global Village, with our camp located at 6:45 & G. We had a total of 45 members.

That year, our members designed and built a unique communal space called the Ark.

In addition to continuing our 2022 offerings like calligraphy tattoos and the ring toss game, we introduced a new service: traditional Chinese massage. During the event, each Burner could enjoy a 15-minute massage session — it was so popular that all spots were usually booked within the first 30 minutes each day.

Our camp artist, Eva, brought her art installation *Respirator* to Burning Man.
