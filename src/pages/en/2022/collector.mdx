# The Collector in BRC

**Art Installation Homepage: [https://brccollector.wordpress.com/](https://brccollector.wordpress.com/)**

The Collector is an interactive art installation that appeared on the playa from August 29th to September 4th, 2022 in Black Rock City, NV.

In 7 days, it collected over 600 voice samples with consent from people who discovered it on the playa. The Collector randomly selects one prompt from below when activated:

- Hello. I am the collector of **stories**. I would like to collect a story from you.
- Hello. I am the collector of **questions**. I would like to collect a question from you.
- Hello. I am the collector of **songs**. I would like to collect a song from you.
- Hello. I am the collector of **voices**. I would like to collect some sounds from you.

Listen to all voices collected. This track contains chronologically arranged samples where 3-4 are played back together at the same time.

Do you have an answer to a collected question?

Please **[[contact me](https://twitter.com/miltonxren)]** if you wish to withdraw your consent to share your voice data, or if your voice was collected by accident.

The center sculpture was heavily inspired by Alex Grey’s work. You can **[[find him here](https://www.instagram.com/alexgreycosm/?hl=en)]**.

The design and source code of the installation can be found **[[here on Github](https://github.com/MiltonRen/BM2022_audio_project/blob/main/README.md)]**. Feel free to build one for yourself!
